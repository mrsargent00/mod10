## Description

This application was created as a homework assignment for the MSU Coding Bootcamp. The challenge required us to use Node.js, Inquirer, and Jest to generate an .svg logo with text.
Users are prompted to input text, choose text color, background color, and select a desired shape.
Once the prompts are completed, a .svg file is generated in the "Complete logo" folder.
To view the file, right-click the .svg and choose "Open in Live" from the context menu.
